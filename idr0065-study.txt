Study Description	Our ability to connect genotypic variation to biologically important phenotypes has been seriously limited by the gap between live-cell microscopy and library-scale genomic engineering. Here, we show how in situ genotyping of a library of strains after time-lapse imaging in a microfluidic device overcomes this problem. We determine how 235 different CRISPR interference knockdowns impact the coordination of the replication and division cycles of Escherichia coli by monitoring the location of replication forks throughout on average >500 cell cycles per knockdown. Subsequent in situ genotyping allows us to map each phenotype distribution to a specific genetic perturbation to determine which genes are important for cell cycle control. The single-cell time-resolved assay allows us to determine the distribution of single-cell growth rates, cell division sizes and replication initiation volumes. The technology presented in this study enables genome-scale screens of most live-cell microscopy assays.

Experiment Number	2			
Comment[IDR Experiment Name]	idr0065-camsund-crispri/experimentB	
Experiment Sample Type	cell		
Experiment Description	After phenotyping, barcode RNAs were expressed by T7 RNApol induction and the cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized. The strains were identified in situ by sequential FISH probing using widefield epi-fluorescence in four colors. Each round of probing identifies the positions of four unique strains.
